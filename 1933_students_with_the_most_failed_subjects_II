select student_id
from exam
group by 1
order by count(case when is_pass = 0 then 1 else 0 end) desc
limit 1


#it is missing data if more than one student has the same highest number
#should use sum instead of count, count will still count 1 when value is 0.

#to make it right
select student_id
from exams
group by 1
having sum(case when is_pass = 0 then 1 else 0 end) = (
select max(cnt)
from (
select student_id, sum(case when is_pass = 0 then 1 else 0 end) cnt
from exams
group by 1)t)

#still not pass the tests
#test case failed
| id | student_id |     date     | is_pass |
| :- | :--------- | :----------- | :------ |
| 1  | 1          | '2020-11-10' | 10      |

expected output
| student_id |
| :--------- |

Mine returned the value

#correct answer is to use where
select student_id
from exams
where is_pass = 0
group by 1
having count(is_pass) = (
select max(cnt)
from (
select student_id, count(is_pass) cnt
from exams
where is_pass = 0
group by 1)t)

#to simplify
select student_id
from exams
where is_pass = 0
group by 1
having count(is_pass) = (
  select count(is_pass)
  from exams
  group by 1
  order by count(is_pass) desc
  limit 1)
