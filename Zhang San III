alter view v_best_teachers as (

#correction: a teacher can teach multiple courses. So we need to sum students up per teacher

alter view v_best_teachers as (
select teacher_id, sum(student_count), country, email
from courses c join teachers t on c.teacher_id = t.id
group by 1,3,4
having (country, sum(student_count)) in (select country, max(cnt) 
                                        from (select teacher_id, sum(student_count) cnt
                                            from courses
                                            group by teacher_id)c join teachers t on c.teacher_id = t.id
                                        group by 1))
order by 3


other solution using window function and group by
create or replace view v_best_teachers as
select teacher_id,student_count,country,email from 
(select cs1.teacher_id,
  sum(cs1.student_count) student_count,
  ts1.country,
  ts1.email,
  rank() over(partition by ts1.country order by sum(cs1.student_count) desc) rnk 
  from teachers ts1
  join courses cs1 on ts1.id=cs1.teacher_id
  group by cs1.teacher_id,ts1.country
) btc
where rnk=1
order by btc.country
